# FAST-LIO-Vehicle

FAST-LIO-Vehicle is a modified version of FAST-LIO which added a chassis observation module in the esikf framework.

## FAST-LIO

**FAST-LIO** (Fast LiDAR-Inertial Odometry) is a computationally efficient and robust LiDAR-inertial odometry package. It fuses LiDAR feature points with IMU data using a tightly-coupled iterated extended Kalman filter to allow robust navigation in fast-motion, noisy or cluttered environments where degeneration occurs.
